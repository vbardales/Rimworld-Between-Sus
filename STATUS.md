remaining:
  - "2026-11-11: unverified: at localize, translation_fr is not done yet; /review-translation is mandatory before the owner's French review (AUDIT.md 6.g, TM rule of 2026-11-11), translation_fr goes through pending_review"
  - "2026-11-11: dependencies (revision 728bef7): Harmony (brrainz.harmony, Workshop 2009463077) is the only dependency, hard, because the code patches with HarmonyLib; no other mod referenced in code or XML; no DLC required; no optional compat (OptionalCompat.xml not needed, Check-OptionalCompat 0 target); 4.f n/a (no animal); multiplayer mods are for 1.1.0"
  - "2026-11-11: unverified: French translation is for the localize stage, art and later work are in Docs/BACKLOG.md"
  - "2026-11-11: unverified: Alexandre's rules (evidence, door sabotage, ejection, ghosts, vote argument) are built but never run in RimWorld; the ghost has no distinct look yet"
  - "2026-11-11: unverified: tasks, sabotage, kill, meeting, vote, win conditions and the 11 roles are built but never run in RimWorld; Harmony targets Pawn.GetGizmos, Pawn_JobTracker.TryTakeOrderedJob and MapGenerator.GenerateMap unchecked in game"
  - "2026-11-11: owner decision: develop every feature first, then Pickle tests produce the captures; rest of the pitch waits for Alexandre, design choices made meanwhile are in Docs/DESIGN.md and can change"
